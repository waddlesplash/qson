# QSON [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/waddlesplash/qson.png)](https://travis-ci.org/waddlesplash/qson)
A fast way to manipulate JSON data from Qt. Under the MIT license.
Both reading and writing are supported, but autoformatting the output is not.

There are some minor advantages to using QSON over QJson, but the greatest is the size of the codebase (QJson has ~2,200 LOC, QSON has ~480).
See all the details and some examples at the [QSON webpage](http://waddlesplash.github.io/qson/).
