#Qt Fast JSON
A fast way to manipulate JSON data from Qt under the MIT license.
Currently, it only *reads* JSON.

This is still in alpha stage, so don't use it without testing it first.
Please report any bugs!

There are some advantages to using QtFastJSON over QJson, but the greatest is the LOC count (~1,700 for the QJson parser, ~260 for the QtFastJSON parser).
See all the details at the [QtFastJSON webpage](http://waddlesplash.github.com/qtfastjson/).
