#Qt Fast JSON
A fast way to manipulate JSON data from Qt under the MIT license.
Both reading and writing are supported, but autoformatting the output is not.

There are some minor advantages to using QtFastJSON over QJson, but the greatest is the size of the codebase (QJson has ~2,200 LOC, QtFastJson has ~480).
See all the details and some examples at the [QtFastJSON webpage](http://waddlesplash.github.com/qtfastjson/).
