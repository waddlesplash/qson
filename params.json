To read the following JSON...\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\"encoding\" : \"UTF-8\",\r\n\"plug-ins\" : [\r\n\t\"python\",\r\n\t\"c++\",\r\n\t\"ruby\"\r\n\t],\r\n\"indent\" : { \"length\" : 3, \"use_space\" : true }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n...while using QJson, you would have to do something like this at the least:\r\n```cpp\r\nQJson::Parser parser;\r\nbool* ok;\r\nQVariantMap result = parser.parse(\"{ ...jsondata... }\", &ok).toMap();\r\nint length = result[\"indent\"].toMap()[\"length\"].toInt();\r\n```\r\nbut if you use QtFastJson you only have to do the following:\r\n```cpp\r\nQtFastJsonDoc* jsonDoc = new QtFastJsonDoc();\r\njsonDoc->readFile(\"json_file.json\",true);\r\nint length = jsonDoc->at(\"indent\")->at(\"length\")->toInt();\r\n```\r\nWriting a document is just as easy:\r\n```cpp\r\nQtFastJsonDoc* jsonDoc = new QtFastJsonDoc();\r\n/* ... do something here to add stuff to the doc ... */\r\nQString json = jsonDoc->writeJSON();\r\n\r\n```\r\nYou could also call ``` writeFile(\"filename\")``` to write output to a file instead of returning it.\r\n","name":"Qt Fast JSON","tagline":"Fast and simple JSON manipulation in Qt."}
