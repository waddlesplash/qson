{"name":"QSON","tagline":"Fast and simple JSON manipulation in Qt.","body":"##What's this?\r\nA fast way to manipulate [JSON](http://www.json.org/) data from [Qt/C++ apps](http://qt-project.org/) under the [MIT license](https://github.com/waddlesplash/qtfastjson/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).\r\n\r\n##Why is this any better than [QJson](http://qjson.sourceforge.net/)?\r\nBecause QJson has about ~2,200 lines of code (including ~960 lines of [Bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)-generated code). QSON has just about 480 lines of code, created by hand.\r\n\r\n(The lines of code were counted by running [CLOC](http://cloc.sourceforge.net/) on the source directories of the projects.)\r\n\r\n##Is the API different than QJson's API?\r\nYes. QSON's API is designed for ease of use and code readability. To read the following JSON...\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\"encoding\" : \"UTF-8\",\r\n\"plug-ins\" : [\r\n\t\"python\",\r\n\t\"c++\",\r\n\t\"ruby\"\r\n\t],\r\n\"indent\" : { \"length\" : 3, \"use_space\" : true }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n...while using QJson, you would have to do something like this at the least:\r\n```cpp\r\nQJson::Parser parser;\r\nbool* ok;\r\nQVariantMap result = parser.parse(\"{ ...jsondata... }\", &ok).toMap();\r\nint length = result[\"indent\"].toMap()[\"length\"].toInt();\r\n```\r\nBut if you use QSON you only have to do the following:\r\n```cpp\r\nQsonDoc* jsonDoc = new QsonDoc();\r\njsonDoc->readFile(\"json_file.json\");\r\nint length = jsonDoc->at(\"indent\")->at(\"length\")->toInt();\r\n```\r\nWriting a document is just as easy:\r\n```cpp\r\nQsonDoc* jsonDoc = new QsonDoc();\r\n/* ... do something here to add stuff to the doc ... */\r\nQString json = jsonDoc->writeJSON();\r\n```\r\nYou could also call ``` writeFile(\"filename\")``` to write output to a file instead of returning it.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
